           == Instructions for Upgrading Netdot 0.9.10 to 1.0.x ==


1. You will need to update the database schema in addition to the application.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING

This new version of Netdot fixes a number of lax database constraints. 
This means that table columns were previously defined in such a way that 
their values could be undefined (NULL) or zero when they should not. 
In additiion, the new version adds UNIQUE constraints to some fields.

It is very likely that applying these constraints to your current schema now 
will fail because there are cases where columns were set to "NULL" or zero, 
or cases where there are duplicate values. This means that you may end up
with an inconsistent schema, hence the importance of having a backup copy
of your database.

After making a backup copy of your database, please execute the following command:

    make upgrade

This will call a script that updates your current database to the schema required 
by the version you are upgrading to. This may take a long time, depending on the 
size of your database.

Any errors found while applying these schema changes will be written to a file
called "error.log". You will need to inspect this file and make sure to correct
any problems before continuing. You may have to restore your database from backup,
fix the data and start over.

2. Run 'make testdeps' to make sure that you satisfy the new dependencies

3. At this point you can do a 'make install'

4. Be aware that Netdot does not include MIB files in the mibs/ directory any more. 
This helps make Netdot more tolerant of changes in the aSNMP libraries (SNMP::Info).
You will need to download the latest version of the 'netdisco-mibs' package, available
here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/netdisco/files/netdisco-mibs/

By default, Netdot expects each vendor directory in the following path:

    /usr/share/netdisco/mibs

So, for example, you can do something like:

    cd /tmp
    wget http://path-to-latest/netdisco-mibs.tar.gz
    mkdir -p /usr/share/netdisco/
    cd /usr/share/netdisco
    tar xzvf /tmp/netisco-mibs.tar.gz
    mv netdisco-mibs mibs

5. Adjust your Site.conf file to reflect some changes:

* Modify SNMP_MIBS_PATH and SNMP_MIBS_DIRS to match the actual path where
  you installed the mibs
