In order to upgrade from version 0.9.x to 1.0.x, you will need to update the database schema
in addition to the application.

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPGRADING

First, note that the DB_HOME setting in Default.conf and Site.conf has changed between 0.9 and 1.0.
Previously, it was the directory your binaries lived in (e.g. /usr/bin), where as now it is one
directory level higher (e.g. /usr). You will need to change this in Site.conf.

After making a backup copy of your database, please execute the following command:

       make upgrade

This will call a script that updates your current database to the schema required by the version
you are upgrading to. This may take a long time, depending on the size of your database.

At this point you can continue with the regular installation process.
